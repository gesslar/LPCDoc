# LPCDoc: Instruction set for LLMs

If you would like assistance from an LLM, either integrated with your IDE, or
at a website, you may find adding an instruction set to your arsenal a bit
helpful when asking them to help generate documentation for you.

This document is an evolving work as we tweak it to help LLMs better understand
the needs for ongoing documentation projects.

It is, however, not versioned.
